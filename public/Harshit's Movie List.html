<h1>Personal Favourite Movies of Harshit</h1>
<h2>Best Movies of all time according to me...</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Harry Potter series</h3>
<p>HP movies are a global sensation for all generations. Almost every person has enjoyed HP in their childhood.<br>
Personally, I've watched almost all the parts at least 6-7 times each.</p>
<h3>Barbie(2023)</h3>
<p>This movie was released on July 21st and it surpassed the expectations of most of the fans. It was such a meaningful, sensational, emotional and inner-healing experience. Plus, Mattel Entreprises need to release an <i>Allan</i> doll. Periodt. </p>
<h3>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</h3>
<p>The only reason for me to watch and enjoy this movie is the SCARLET WITCH.. She was so BADASS and INEVITABLY POWERFUL!!<br>She served and slayed in her villain era and I'm all down for it~
